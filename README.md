<h2 style="font-family:Lucida Console;">Zombies On The Rise</h2>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Introduction</h1>
<p>I created and designed this website to describe the development, release and legacy of what I consider to be one of the best games ever made, entitled: Zombies Ate My Neighbors. It was something that I enjoyed playing with my brother and friends growing up, and is one of the fondest memories I have from when i was a kid first playing video games and the one I remember begging my mom to rent over and over every friday night.</p>

<p>Not only is the game visually appealing but the mayhem in co-op is just outstanding and so well done for a game of its time period, and with only 16 bits of graphics to work with it is a crowning achievment of Nintendo Industry in my opinion. Although it was not well recieved at launch it quickly became a cult classic that many of us know and love to this day. I for one think this game should be in the hall of fame of gaming if it is not so already or if there is not a HoF of gaming than we should create one.</p>

<p><h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Development</h1>
Zombies Ate My Neighbors was originally developed by LucasArts. It was published by Konami, a company already known for platformers in 1993. Music for the game was composed by Joseph "Joe" McDermott. The game was developed on the Super Nintendo, before it was ported to the Sega Genesis about halfway through. The ZAMN engine would later be used for Ghoul Patrol(Figure 2), Metal Warriors and Big Sky Trooper. The developer wanted to include battery save in the game but was unable to as they could not afford it.</p>

<p>The monsters in the game are based on classic horror films released in the 1950s and more modern films like Friday the 13th and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Weapon effectiveness is also based on these depictions; werewolves die in one hit if attacked with silverware and vampires die faster if attacked with the crucifix. In the SNES version of the game, there's a flamethrower which is not included in the Sega Mega Drive version. The North American release was released with a variant cover art in limited quantities(see figure 3).</p>

<p><h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Release</h1>
The game was subject to some censorship. This game was released before the ESRB existed and before then, Nintendo did not want violence in their video games. Nintendo of America ordered all depictions of blood and gore be removed or changed to purple ooze. Censorship committees in several European Nations—i.e. United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Germany—censored more by having the game renamed to Zombies and ordered other changes including the replacement of the chainsaw-wielding enemies with lumberjacks wielding axes.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Lucida Console;">Heros Get Remembered, But Legends Never Die...</h2>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Legacy</h1>

<p>In 1997, LucasArts released a game for Sony's PlayStation and Sega's Sega Saturn titled Herc's Adventures, which uses the same basic gameplay format and mechanics as Zombies Ate My Neighbors. Programmer Chris Long cited Zombies Ate My Neighbors as a major influence on his 1997 game Swagman.</P

<p>Day of the Tentacle, another game developed by LucasArts, is referenced in Zombies Ate My Neighbors through a secret level. Comparisons to the game Dead Rising(figure 4), released for the Xbox 360 in 2006, have been drawn, Lucas Thomas of IGN saying "Zombies Ate My Neighbors is basically a comical 16-bit template for the new Xbox 360 release, Dead Rising. And like that game, this one arms you with a pretty bizarre arsenal. Weed whackers, exploding soda cans and flying silverware all make an appearance to help you, or you and a friend, put a hurt on these living dead."</p>

<p><h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Sequels and spin-offs</h1>
A sequel entitled Ghoul Patrol(figure 2) was released in 1994, but was not as well received as its predecessor. Originally, Ghoul Patrol was not intended to be released as a sequel to Zombies Ate My Neighbors, but was re-worked as such to increase sales.</p>

<p>As of 2011, a film based on the game was in development. The film was being penned and produced by screenwriter and director John Darko, known for his work on James Wan's Insidious and Aaron Sims' Archetype. At the time of report, the film was in the process of securing rights from LucasArts and obtaining a director as well as financing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this film is in development purgatory with no plans on ever seeing the light of day thanks to lucasArts being owned by Disney. Even if there ever is a movie it will not be the version we would all hope to see. That is why I beleive it is better left as the perfect game that it is. Like the old motto says "If it ain't broke don't fix it", this is especially true with a classic like Zombies Ate My Neighbors.</p>
